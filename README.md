## üöÄ Deployment Guide (Vercel)

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

If you haven't already:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Create a new repository on GitHub, then:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 2. Prepare Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
```

You will add these to Vercel in the next step.

---

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click **"New Project"** and import your repository.
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js. Click **"Deploy"**.
4. When prompted, add your environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
5. Wait for the build to finish. You'll get a live URL (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
